    <h3>Week 1 Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I think it is interesting how in just a few years (since 2011), 
            the paradigm shift of having a computer went from one computer 
            desktop per household to being 2-3 devices per person in the household.
            The devices being a smart phone usually one per person, maybe a tablet f
            or the parents and usually another device of some sort. </li>
        <li>Be There. Be Useful. Be Quick.</li>
        <li>Multiple steps can frustrate you. 0 steps make you happy without even thinking about it.</li>
        <li>Speed Matters. People noticed the half second delay it takes for things to load. </li>
        <li>Fingers Matter. We want to design with the most convenient placement of fingers.  </li>
        <li>Size Matters. Reduce un-needed white space to reduce size.</li>
        <li>There are better ways to do things.</li>
        <li>Advertise not Annoy. NO POP-UPS</li>
    </ul>
